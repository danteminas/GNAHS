# Ground Navigation at High Speeds (GNAHS)
## What's in this repository?
A collection of files used for the GNAHS project. Full documentation is in a Google Drive folder

## What is it?
The this project is a high-speed remote-controlled car fully designed in-house and built from scratch. It is funded through the New York University MakerSpace Prototyping Fund and will be produced using the NYU MakerSpace. 

## Current status: Prototype Development (updated 11/4/2024)
### Electronics:
Arduinos and their components are being tested under controlled environments. nRF24L01 2.4GHz transceiver modules are being tested and used to control DC and servo motors remotely.
To-do: Finalize circuit designs, design PCBs, manufacture PCBs, solder PCBs, affix to prototype

### Mechanics:
A rough prototype made of wood and 3d prints is being manufactured. It will house rough electronics that will be taped or otherwise MacGyvered together. An intial CAD model for the final design has been created.
To-do: iterate on CAD model, determine how it can be manufactured, determine ideal materials (e.g. aluminum, ABS, wood), manufacture.

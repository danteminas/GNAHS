# Ground Navigation at High Speeds (GNAHS)
## What's in this repository?
A collection of files used for the GNAHS project. Full documentation is in the Google Drive folder. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PZfH0M-oUMHmwuCybx-IKrOHdIKsB8Ay?usp=drive_link)

## What is it?
The this project is a high-speed remote-controlled car fully designed in-house and built from scratch. It is funded through the New York University MakerSpace Prototyping Fund and will be produced using the NYU MakerSpace.

## Current status: Post-prototype improvement (updated 2/3/2024)
### Electronics:
The electronics are working reliably, doing everything it is supposed to! Turning the device on is a bit complicated, that needs to be improved for user experience.
To-do:
- Improve boot-up sequence
- Re-manufacture PCBs
- Add sensors!

### Mechanics:
The prototype is complete and can successfully drive around! However, the motors' torque is a bit too low for it to start on its own.\
To-do:
- Get more torque from the motors
- Fix/improve steering mechanism
- Improve the junction between the wheel and the axle (better bearings?)

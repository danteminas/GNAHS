# Ground Navigation at High Speeds (GNAHS)
## What's in this repository?
A collection of files used for the GNAHS project. Full documentation is in the Google Drive folder. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PZfH0M-oUMHmwuCybx-IKrOHdIKsB8Ay?usp=drive_link)

## What is it?
The this project is a high-speed remote-controlled car fully designed in-house and built from scratch. It is funded through the New York University MakerSpace Prototyping Fund and will be produced using the NYU MakerSpace.

## Current status: Testing and post-prototype design (updated 11/19/2024)
### Electronics:
~~Arduinos and their components are being tested under controlled environments. nRF24L01 2.4GHz transceiver modules are being tested and used to control DC and servo motors remotely.~~\
Big boy motors have been tested and are now working with ESCs\
To-do:
- Integrate ESCs with wireless communication
- Integrate Servo motor support
- Design/manufacture/solder PCBs

### Mechanics:
A rough prototype made of wood and 3d prints is being manufactured. It will house rough electronics that will be taped or otherwise MacGyvered together. An intial CAD model for the final design has been created.\
To-do:
- Determine how to steer the car (will likely take inspiration from hobbyists online)
- Determine how wheels will be affixed to motors
- Design remote
- Manufacture it all!
